# SOCAnalyst_ChatBot_RAG - SOCMate

## üìå Problem Statement
SOC analysts work under intense time pressure, needing quick access to vital information hidden in large volumes of technical documents like **security policies, incident response guides, and threat reports**.  

Manually searching these slows investigations, risks missed details, and delays critical decisions.  

To address this challenge, we developed an **intelligent, context-aware chatbot** that leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and locally hosted **Large Language Models (LLMs)** via **Ollama**.  

This system will:
- Ingest domain-specific cybersecurity documents.
- Retrieve the most relevant content in response to user queries.
- Generate concise, accurate answers.

By incorporating **conversational memory**, the chatbot will also understand follow-up questions in the context of prior interactions ‚Äî enabling faster access to knowledge, reducing cognitive load, and enhancing operational efficiency for SOC analysts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Approach
1. Read security PDFs using **pdfplumber** and **PyPDF2**, with OCR (**pytesseract**) for scanned files.
2. Use **spaCy** and **regex** to remove noise and prepare text for semantic search.
3. Break documents into meaningful sections with **LangChain‚Äôs SemanticChunker** for accurate retrieval.
4. Create embeddings with **HuggingFace** models and store them in **ChromaDB** for fast search.
5. Improve query accuracy with **MultiQueryRetriever** before sending context to the LLM.
6. Use a local **LLaMA3 model (ChatOllama)** to give precise, context-based answers.
7. Keep chat history using **ConversationBufferMemory** for smooth follow-up questions.
8. Offer a **Gradio** web app so analysts can interact with the assistant effortlessly.
